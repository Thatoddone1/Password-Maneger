# Installation/runing the program
curently i dont have a .exe file for the program so you just have to run the python script.
to run it just run the main.py file (witch you can download from the latest release of the program https://github.com/Thatoddone1/TCPM/releases) with python 3.8 to install python 3.8 go to https://www.python.org/downloads or for debian/ubuntu user simpley do 'sudo apt install python3' and for archLinux users just do 'pacman -S python3'. then once you have installed python open up your terminal (cmd or power shell for win users and termanal for mac useers and whatever termanal softwere you use if you use linux) then make sure you are in the dir wre the main.py file is and run 'python3 main.py' and the program should start
